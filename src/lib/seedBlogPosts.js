        <p>Hijama (cupping therapy) is a time‑tested therapy used to restore balance, improve circulation, and support the body’s natural detox process. This guide walks you through the <strong>types of cupping</strong>, <strong>key benefits</strong>, and <strong>what to expect</strong> during your first session.</p>
        <h2>How Hijama Works</h2>
        <p>Gentle suction is created inside a cup to draw blood to the surface and stimulate lymphatic drainage. In wet cupping, a small superficial scratch is made to remove stagnant blood; in dry cupping, there is suction only.</p>
        <h2>Benefits at a Glance</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Relieves muscle tightness and back/neck pain</li>
          <li>Reduces inflammation and speeds recovery</li>
          <li>Supports detoxification and immune function</li>
          <li>Can improve sleep and headaches in many clients</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>What to Expect in a Session</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>Brief consultation and health screen</li>
          <li>Target area selection and warm‑up massage</li>
          <li>Cups applied for 5–15 minutes</li>
          <li>Aftercare: hydration, light activity, and avoiding hot showers for 24 hours</li>
        </ol>
        <blockquote>Note: Circular marks are normal and typically fade within 3–7 days.</blockquote>

        <p>Both wet and dry cupping share the same goal—enhanced circulation and relief from tension—but they differ in technique and intensity.</p>
        <h2>Dry Cupping</h2>
        <p>Uses suction only. Ideal for <em>muscle tightness, stress relief,</em> and first‑time clients who want a gentle introduction.</p>
        <h2>Wet Cupping</h2>
        <p>Combines suction with a small superficial scratch to remove stagnant blood. Traditionally used for <strong>detoxification</strong> and stubborn, chronic pain patterns.</p>
        <h2>Choosing What’s Best</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>New to cupping?</strong> Start with dry cupping.</li>
          <li><strong>Chronic aches or heavy soreness?</strong> Consider wet cupping under practitioner guidance.</li>
          <li><strong>Athletic recovery?</strong> Dry cupping between training days can help reduce DOMS.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>From Olympic swimmers to footballers, athletes use cupping to <strong>reduce recovery time</strong> and keep muscles primed for performance.</p>
        <h2>Why Athletes Love Cupping</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Flushes metabolic waste after intense training</li>
          <li>Releases adhesions and improves tissue glide</li>
          <li>Supports joint mobility and flexibility</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>When to Schedule</h2>
        <p>Dry cupping is best 24–72 hours after heavy sessions. Avoid wet cupping within the 5–7 days before competition.</p>

        <p>Evidence suggests that cupping can modulate inflammatory markers, stimulate microcirculation, and trigger a local healing response similar to “controlled micro‑trauma.”</p>
        <h2>Key Mechanisms</h2>
        <ul>
          <li><strong>Microcirculation boost:</strong> Increased blood flow nourishes tissues.</li>
          <li><strong>Neuro‑immune effects:</strong> May down‑regulate pain pathways.</li>
          <li><strong>Fascia release:</strong> Improves tissue glide and reduces stiffness.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While research continues to grow, client outcomes for back pain, neck tension, and migraines are particularly promising.</p>

        <p>Stress settles in the body—tight shoulders, jaw clenching, shallow breathing. Cupping can interrupt this cycle by relaxing the nervous system and relieving somatic tension.</p>
        <h2>How It Helps</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>Encourages parasympathetic (rest‑and‑digest) activity</li>
          <li>Releases trigger points linked to stress headaches</li>
          <li>Pairs well with breathwork and gentle mobility</li>
        </ul>
        <p>While cupping is <em>not</em> a replacement for professional mental health care, many clients report improved mood and sleep quality after sessions.</p>
